<h3> Conditional Operators

</h3>

<p>Allows us to evaluate whether or not certain expressions are true <br>We write these conditions as part of our if statement

<br>Inside of an if statement we can also ask questions to determine if something evaluates to true or not. We can do these using conditional operators. 

</p>


<img src="assets/img/operatorsimg.png" alt="">


<pre>number = int(input("Please enter a number:"))

if number < 5:
    print("The number is less than 5")</pre>

<p>code will only run if a number input is less than 5 and return the number is less than 5</p>


<p>we can also use the <= operator, this means less than or equal too, so 5 included if we enter the number 5 or less, however Note: Except for the equal to operator, none of these operators will work for strings.

</p>

<h3>challenge conditional operators</h3>

<p>Conditional Operators - Required:
In the execution flow challenges you learned that you can define variables and test their values using if statements in order to determine which block of code should execute. As you learned in the Operators lessons, there are also several conditional operators you can use to compare different values together. Some of them we'll be working with often are:

Less Than: <
Less Than or Equal To: <=
Equal To: ==
Greater Than or Equal To: >=
Greater Than: >

To demonstrate the use of these operators, we've written a small function, test_integer(), which takes a variable, my_int, as a parameter. You don't need to worry about defining the variable here; we'll pass it in already defined during the test. However, if you run the code right now you'll see that the function returns None for all the numbers from 1-20. 

Your challenge is to:
Complete the function by writing an if statement that returns "10 or less" if my_int is less than or equal to 10, or
Returns "greater than 10" if my_int is greater than 10

By doing this, you should see the phrases "1 is 10 or less" through "20 is greater than 10", each printed on a new line when you click run.

Requirements:
You only need to write the if statement inside the function.
The return line should be replaced with your if statement so that the function can return two different results, depending on the number passed into it</p>

<h3>solution</h3>

<img src="assets/img/operatorchaless.png" alt="">


<h4>code</h4>
<pre>def test_integer(my_int):
    # Write your if statement here:
    if my_int <= 10:
     return ("10 or less")
    else:
     return ("greater than 10")


# Do not modify below this line
for x in range(1,21):
    print(f'{x} is {test_integer(x)}')
    </pre>


<h3> Additional Clauses - Part One
</h3>

<h4>Else and elif clauses

</h4>

<p>Provide us with the ability to handle different conditions

<br>Sometimes we might need to be a bit more expressive than simply using an if statement. This means also having if-else-elif ladders

</p>

<p>An 'if statement', establishes if a condition is true or false. Following on from this, we also need to make additional decisions, so Python includes elif and else. The code should instruct the computer if 'some condition', then 'do something', else 'do something else'. Let’s take a look at the example below:

</p>




<p>In this example, we have decided to provide feedback to a user. The user enters a number, and if that number is equal to 5, the user will be told that their number is equal to 5. Else the user is informed that their number is not equal to 5. else operates as a catch-all clause. The else clause handles anything that has not already been dealt with in the 'if clause'. Therefore we don’t need to specify any clauses in the else statement.

</p>

<pre>number = int(input("Please enter a number:"))

if number == 5:
    print(f"{number} is equal to 5")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not equal to 5")</pre>

<p>when we need additional params we use the elif also like javascripts elseif see example below</p>

<pre>number = int(input("Please enter a number:"))

if number > 5:
    print(f"{number} is greater than 5")
elif number < 5:
    print(f"{number} is less than 5")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not greater than, or less than 5. Therefore, {number} must be equal to 5.")</pre>


<p>In this example, we have an if condition that checks to see if a number is greater than 5. If that statement doesn’t evaluate to true, then it falls to the elif statement. The elif statement then checks to see if the number is less than 5. Lastly, if this check fails, then it will default to the else statement. If the number is greater than five, then we print out a message, stating that the number entered is greater than 5. Else if the number is less than five, then we print out a message indicating this. Else, if the number is neither greater than or less than 5, then the number must be equal to 5. Although we didn’t use the equal to operator here, we were able to deduce that because the number isn’t greater than 5, or less than 5, it has to be equal to 5.

</p>

<h3>challenge elif else if//</h3>

<p>In the first execution flow challenge you used a boolean variable to determine whether or not you would survive a zombie apocalypse. Let's build on that with this next challenge. You may recall learning in the Operators lesson that you can use multiple clauses in your if statements. For example, to determine whether a section of code should execute based on a boolean variable being true or false, you can simply do something like: 
</p>

<pre>def some_function():
    some_thing = False
    if some_thing:
        print("some_thing is True!")
    else:
        print("some_thing is False!")</pre>

<p>Notice that we technically don't even need the else, because if we know that some_thing is False, we implicitly know that it is not True, so we could even do this and get the exact same result:</p>

<pre>def some_function():
    some_thing = False
    if some_thing:
        print("some_thing is True!")

    print("some_thing is False!")</pre>

<h3>above notice the indentation which removes the neeed for the else statement.</h3>

<p>But what if we wanted to have multiple possible results? Remember the use of the if ... elif ... else syntax! In the code window we've written a small function, number_size(), which takes an integer, num, as a parameter and currently returns nothing. You don't need to worry about defining num, we'll do that for you when running the tests</p>

<p>Your challenge is to:
Replace the return statement with an if statement that:
Returns the string "small" if the number is less than 10
Returns the string "large" if the number is greater than 10, and
Returns the number itself (10) if the number is equal to 10</p>


<h2>nailed this one....</h2>
<h3>solution</h3>

<pre>def number_size(num):
    # Replace the return statement with your if statement here
    if num  <10:
      return ('small')
      
    elif num  >10:
      return ('large')
    
    elif num == 10:
      return num
   




# Do not change anything below this line
for num in range(0, 21):
    print(f'{num} is {number_size(num)}')</pre>

    <img src="assets/img/elifchallenge.png" alt="">



    <h3>however model solution</h3>
    <p>only difference if we finish with the else, probably better</p>

    <pre>def number_size(num):
    if num < 10:
        return "small"
    elif num > 10:
        return "large"
    else:
        return num

# Do not change anything below this line
for num in range(0, 21):
    print(f'{num} is {number_size(num)}')</pre>

<h3>logical operators</h3>
<p>Logical operators allow us to chain multiple conditions together. <br>We can use the not, or and and operators
</p>
<img src="assets/img/logop.png" alt="">


<p>
Instead of just checking something is true, we can also check to see if something is not true. We can also chain conditions together to see if condition1 and condition2 are true. And we can also test to see if either condition1 or condition2 is true. To do this, we have to use what are called logical operators. Don’t worry though! This time we don’t have to learn about symbols because Python uses everyday words for these operators.

</p>

<p>example</p>

<pre>exit_program = False

if exit_program:
    print("This program will not exit just yet")
else:
    print("This program will now be terminated...")</pre>


<p>The if clause is considered to be False, meaning the print function inside it is not executed. Instead, it falls to the else and prints out, “This program will now be terminated…” even though the exit_program variable is set to False.

</p>


<p>When we’re building programs, videos game, websites, etc. there are two different categories of bugs that we can inadvertently introduce into our code. These are syntax errors and logical errors. Syntax errors occur when we have issues in our code that explicitly cause Python to stop running. If we tried to divide an int by a string, for example, Python would not be happy about it! Logical errors occur when our logic fails us, or we misuse a part of the language based on an assumption. Expecting if False: to evaluate to true, for example, would cause a logical error. If we wanted to get around this issue, then we would have to use the not operator.

</p>

<pre>exit_program = False

if not exit_program:
    print("This program will not exit just yet")
else:
    print("This program will now be terminated...")
</pre>

<p> returns 'This program will not exit just yet'</p>


<p>Here we’re unfortunately dealing with a double negative. Not false will equate to true. Meaning our condition will evaluate to true and the code inside the if clause will execute. Try changing the exit_program variable to True to see what happens.

</p>


<h3>logical operator part 3</h3>
<h3>AND operator </h3>

<p>Let’s take a look at the and operator. This time we want to check to see if the program should be terminated AND all critical systems have been shut down. We need to check to see if all the vital systems have been shut down before we can safely exit the program. To achieve this, we have two bools: exit_program and critical_systems_shutdown. Let’s look at how that will work:

</p>

<pre>exit_program = True
critical_systems_shutdown = True

if exit_program and critical_systems_shutdown:
    print("Safely terminating program...")
else:
    print("This program will not exit just yet")</pre>

<p>In this example, we check to see if exit_program AND critical_systems_shutdown are True. If both are, then we print out “Safely terminating program…”, else “This program will not exit just yet” will be printed. Try playing around with exit_program and critical_systems_shutdown to see what might happen if you change their boolean values. The or operator works in a similar way to the and operator. The difference is that both conditions in an and clause MUST evaluate to true; however, with the or operator at least one condition must be true. Let’s take a look at it in the example below:

</p>

<h3>or operator.... only one of the statements need to be true for the code to run</h3>

<pre>exit_program = False
manual_override = True

if exit_program or manual_override:
    print("This program will now be terminated...")
else:
    print("This program will not exit just yet")</pre>

<p>This time we have two variables with boolean values: exit_program is False and manual_override is True. In our, if condition, we check to see if either of those values are true. Python will check each condition until it finds one that is true. If the first condition is true, then it doesn’t care about the second condition as one of them has already been seen to be true.

</p>

<h3>operators challenge.</h3>

<p>In the Operators lesson you learned about a set of operators called Logical Operators. These operators can help you to apply logic to your code, particularly conditional code like if statements. The logical operators include: 

and, which returns true when both conditions are true
or, which returns true when either condition is true
not, which returns the opposite of whatever it's applied to

You can (and often will be required to) use these operators to make your Python code behave in a reliable and predictable way. In the code window we've started a small function, opposites(), which takes a single argument, item, and currently returns nothing.

Your challenge is to:
Make the function return the opposite of item using a logical operator.</p>

<pre>def opposites(item):
    # Return the opposite here
    not item == True  
  
    return not item



# Experiment with different values in 
# place of True here if you're stuck!
print(opposites(True))</pre>


<h3>Nesting conditions</h3>


<p>Provide a means of implementing additional if-else ladders inside of existing if-else blocks

<br>Sometimes we may need run additional checks inside of an if, elif, or else block. To do this, we write our new if-elif-else block inside of an existing if-elif-else block

<br>We can write an if-elif-else statement inside another if-elif-else statement which is called nesting conditions. Let’s take a look at what this might look like:

</p>


<img src="assets/img/nestel.png" alt="">


<p>In this example, we’ve started by declaring three variables – exit_program, manual_override, and critical_systems_shutdown. In the if statement, we have two conditions. We are checking to see if both exit_program and critical_systems_shutdown are False. If both are False, then inside our if block we write another check to see if manual_override is True. If manual_override is True, then we print out “Shutting system down manually”. else we print out “This program will not exit just yet”. Else if exit_program is True, but critical_systems_shutdown is False, then we print out “Critical systems must be safely shut down before exiting the program”. Else, if both exit_program and critical_systems_shutdown are True, then we exit the program by printing “This program will now be terminated…”</p>


<h3>nested challenge</h3>

<p>Over the last several challenges you've learned to work with logical and conditional operators and if ... elif ... else statements. The final step in understanding Python logic is to understand Nesting. Nesting is common in almost every programming language, and usually is simply a way of telling the language with more granularity when it should execute certain blocks of code. A common use case for this might be if you want to perform some actions only if another condition is true, but the action you want to perform also requires some additional checks to decide how it should be performed. For example:</p>



<pre>if thing1:
    if thing1a:
        # Do thing1a action
    elif thing1b:
        # Do thing1b action
    elif thing1c:
        # Do thing1c action
    else:
        # Do some default action
elif thing2:
    # do thing2 action
else:
    # Do something completely different 
</pre>

<p>In the above code, it should be relatively clear that in order to get to, say, "thing1a action", first thing1 itself must be True, and then once we're inside that if statement, thing1a must be True. It's also important to understand that Python will read this code from top to bottom, but it will skip anything it knows it won't need. For example, if thing1 is False, Python knows immediately that it doesn't need to check whether thing1a, thing1b or thing1c are True or False, and will simply skip to checking whether thing2 is True or False.

In this way you can design code that is very granular and allows you to check all sorts of conditions and have many different results depending on different situations! 

In the code window we've started a small function, check_engine(), which takes in three parameters, oil, coolant, and gasoline. We'll define those variables for you when we run the test, so you can focus on just writing the nested condition. For simplicity, we'll feed those variables in as either 1 (meaning it's good) or 0 (meaning it's bad). With that in mind, we all know that a vehicle needs oil, gas and coolant to run properly...

Your challenge is to:
Replace the return statement with a nested if statement that meets the following requirements: br
Requirements:
If oil is equal to 1, then return the string "engine started!" only if gasoline is equal to 1 and coolant is equal to 1. Otherwise, return the string "gas or coolant issue"
Otherwise, return the string "oil issue"
You must use a nested if statement in your code
</p>

<h3>Ternary operator</h3>
<p>if expression: Allows us to write shorthand if statements <br>Sometimes we don’t need to create lengthy if-else conditions, as it would be easier to work with a single one-liner. In this instance, we’d use an if expression

<br>In addition to using the if-else ladders that we’ve been using up until now, Python also comes with a shorthand version of the if-else statements that is usually called the if expression. Let’s take a look!

</p>

<pre>my_boolean = False

my_string = "Hello" if my_boolean else "World"

print(my_string)</pre>

<p>prints out : World.</p>

<p>In this example, we create a new variable called my_boolean and assign it a value of False. Then on line 3, we create a new variable called my_string. Then we use the if expression to assign a value to my_string based on whether or not a particular condition is true.

The way the if expression works is as follows: expression1 if condition else expression2

Expression1 will be the value assigned to my_string if the condition is true, else expression2. In this case, my_string will be assigned a value of 'World' because the condition (my_boolean) is false.</p>

<h3>ternary operator challenge</h3>

<p>As you write more and more if statements, you'll start to see that complex logic can make your code quite long. In Python there are many ways to write your code in a sort of shorthand, abbreviated way. One way to do this is by using the ternary operator. It's simply a shorthand if statement that can come in handy for quick checks in your code.

Here we've started a function, one_liner(), which takes a single variable, val, and currently returns nothing.

Your challenge is to:
Modify the return statement to return a boolean True if supplied_val is 1, or False otherwise

Requirements:
Your function, aside from blank lines and comments for readability, must contain only a single line of code, the return statement
</p>


<pre>def one_liner(supplied_val):
    # Modify the return statement to use a ternary operator
    return True if val else False



# Check your code by experimenting with
# different values for val here
val = 1
print(one_liner(val))</pre> 
<p>???</p>

<h3>while loops</h3>


<p>Provide us with the ability to perform repetitive tasks

 <br>Sometimes we might need to re-run the same good code over and over again. To do this, we use while loops that will run while some condition is true

</p>

<img src="assets/img/while.png" alt="">

<img src="assets/img/while1.png" alt="">
<p>explained: countdown number - start here, while the countdown number is more than or equal to 0 run the loop and print the countdown number, each loop remove one (-=0) thus returning the countdown printed </p>

<p>In this example we declare a variable called countdown_number, then we proceed to begin a countdown sequence. Then we have our while loop. We create this by starting with the while keyword, followed by a condition. In this case, the code inside the while loop will be executed so long as countdown_number is greater than or equal to 0. Inside the while block, we print out the countdown_number, followed by the word “seconds”. Next, we subtract 1 from the countdown_number, meaning that with each iteration, the countdown_number gets closer to 0. Once the countdown_number reaches 0, on the last iteration the countdown_number will be set to -1. Since this value is not greater than or equal to 0, the conditional expression of the while loop won’t evaluate to true and the while loop will be skipped. After exiting the loop, we simply print out, “And We Have Lift Off!”</p>

<img src="assets/img/while3.png" alt="">

<p>Here we’ve declared a variable called play_game which is set to true. While play_game is true, we do the following. First, we ask the user if they wish to continue playing the game. We indicate the answer should be yes or no (“y/n”). We then store this value in a variable called continue_playing. We then check to see if continue_playing is equal to “y”. If it is, then we tell them that they’ve decided to continue playing.

<br>NOTE: We’ve used the .lower() method, just in case a user uses an uppercase input. When working with uppercase and lowercase, it’s important to note that, while they are the same letter, they are not the same string.
<br>If this is the case, then the while loop will begin its next cycle, and the user will be prompted again. Else if continue_playing is equal to “n”, then we inform them that they’ve decided to quit the game, and we set the play_game variable to false. Now that the play_game variable is no longer true, the program will exit the loop and print out, “Thanks for playing.” Lastly, if the user enters something other than y or n, then they’ll be informed that their decision was invalid and they need to try again.


</p>


<h3>challenge - while loops</h3>
<p>While loops allow you to tell Python to do something "while" a condition is true. For example, if you wanted to implement a countdown timer, you might write a while loop that executes a block of code every second, while a variable called time is greater than or equal to zero. In this way the same block of code would execute over and over again until time is no longer greater than or equal to zero. Then the program will move on to the next block of code.

You can control which code gets executed within the while loop by properly indenting your code: any code you'd like to execute should be indented at least one indent level with respect to the first line of the while loop. 

Here we've started a small function, listmaker(). It's supposed to use a while loop to add some numbers to a list (which it does by using numbers.append() - you'll learn about this later ... don't worry about it for now) The function currently has a couple variables defined but doesn't return anything, and has a couple syntax errors. You're going to use your knowledge of while loops to fix it!

Your challenge is to:
Define the current_number variable on line 3 to be some integer greater than 10 by replacing #??? with your value
Replace #something ... on line 5 with the proper while loop syntax to make sure the code on lines 6-8 executes until current number is less than 0

If your code is correct, when you run it you'll see output like this, assuming current_number = 15:</p>


<p>fixes including adding value to the current number and envoking the while look using current_number >=0 see below</p>
