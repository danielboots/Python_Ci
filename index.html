<p>Notes</p>

<h2>Python </h2>
<p>the print function</p>

<p> Print provides a way of outputting data </p>
<p> we use the </p>

<pre>print("Display this message")</pre>

<p>We’ll cover functions in much more detail throughout the course, but for now, all we need to know about is the print() function.

The print() function, as its name suggests, displays information on the screen. It is used in command line (or terminal) or scripts, which is what we'll be working with throughout this module. So, you're about to become very familiar with the print() function! Let's have a look at it in action. </p>


<p>Here we are invoking the print() function. To do this, we use the function name, which in this instance is print followed by a pair of brackets or parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we’ll pass through an argument. When we want a function to act on a value, we put it inside the brackets. In this example, we are calling the print() function twice. Firstly, we pass in a value of "Hello world!", secondly we pass in multiple values.

Have a play around with print() and see what happens. What happens if you try do maths, like: print(5 + 16)?</p>


<pre>print("Hello world!")

print("Please", "say", "hello", "back!")</pre>


<h3>Req Challenge, print("") function</h3>

<pre># Use the print() function to print the phrase "Python is awesome!" below this line


print('Python is awesome!')</pre>


<h3>numbers</h3>

<p>Here we’re going to look at how we can do some simple arithmetic using Python. In the following example we’re just adding two numbers; 4 + 4

</p>
<pre>print(4 + 4)</pre> <p>no "" quotation marks are for strings.</p>
